## Documentation Protocols

### Business Rules Consistency
*   **Single Source of Truth**: The `docs/business-rules.md` file is the source of truth for all functional requirements.
*   **Update Rule**: Any change to the system's logic, constraints, or features MUST be recorded in `docs/business-rules.md` before or immediately parallel to implementation.
*   **Traceability**: Code changes should reflect the rules defined in the documentation.
