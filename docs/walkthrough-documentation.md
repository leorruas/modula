# Walkthrough: Smart Layout Documentation Alignment

This document serves as a summary of the alignment process to formalize the **Smart Layout System** into the project's permanent documentation and AI agent skills.

## 1. Engineering Standards
We have codified the architecture and technical requirements to ensure future stability.
- **[engineering-handbook.md](file:///Users/leoruas/Desktop/modula/docs/engineering-handbook.md)**: 
    - Established the **"No-Guesswork"** policy.
    - Documented the **Measurement -> Analysis -> Orchestration** lifecycle.
- **[business-rules.md](file:///Users/leoruas/Desktop/modula/docs/business-rules.md)**: 
    - Formalized the logic for **Dynamic Margins**, **Universal Legend Solver**, and **Anti-Wrapping**.
- **[smart-layout-system.md](file:///Users/leoruas/Desktop/modula/docs/smart-layout-system.md)**: 
    - Updated with advanced intelligence capsules like **Self-Healing** and **Vacuum-Seal**.

## 2. Visual & Design Intelligence
Formalized the "Design-First" approach to layout.
- **[style-guide.md](file:///Users/leoruas/Desktop/modula/docs/style-guide.md)**: 
    - Added the **Anti-Wrapping Hierarchy**.
    - Documented the **No-Ellipsis Policy (Atomic Labels)**.
- **[DESIGN_SYSTEM_RULES.md](file:///Users/leoruas/Desktop/modula/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM_RULES.md)**: 
    - Incorporated **LOD (Level of Detail)** and **Contrast-Aware Accessibility**.

## 3. Codified Agent Skills
The intelligence is now part of the agent's core reasoning.
- **`system_architecture`**: Now mandates predictive sizing and retry loops.
- **`gestalt_grid`**: Now understands "Vacuum-Seal" and "Proximity Gravity".
- **`infography`**: Now "knows" the Spider Collision algorithm.
- **`advanced_analytics`**: Now applies Smart Sorting and Semantic Value Scaling.

## 4. Evidence of Resolution
All architectural issues identified during the Smart Layout development are now considered foundational knowledge, preventing future regressions.
